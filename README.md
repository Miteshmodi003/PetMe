# PROJECT II - PetMe 

## Team Name: Team FullStack 
A team of four {Michael, Faithful, Mitesh, Bobby} who worked together to design and build an app using the MVC paradigm and a server-side API. 



## Elevator Pitch 
No health issues, regular visits to the doctors, pill intake, nor even the common denominator of all - depression! Above all, a world filled with fit adults bringing up strong, responsible, empathetic kids!  How is that even possible? - you may ask!
Do not worry, we have got the answer for you here at Pet Me Shelters. All guests who made a stop at our shelter, ended up leading healthy lives afterwards.At Our Shelter, we are dedicated to ensuring you live your best lives. Get Started with a Buddy!




## Project Description
"Everybuddy needs a Buddy" as the saying goes.
Pet Me is an application designed to assist people looking for that special pet. We facilitate pet adoption and ensure everyone makes the right buddy choice.



## Motivation for Development
Due to the situation in our world today, the high decline in human health, animal cruelty, irresponsible adults, We as a team had the strong need to create pet me shelter. This shelter will be of huge help to families, it would help in the increase of mentally healthy individuals, family bonding, and even create job opportunities in the future.



## User Story
Given that I'm a guest user, when I open the home page, I would like to choose a pet option, I want to be able to view an image gallery depicting different pets, in order to make the right adoptive choice and view donation opportunities. When I click on the image, it reveals detailed information about the pet and allows me to make purchases. 
This application should also help users that are going through depression, loneliness, family's bond, encourage a sense of responsibility in kids and their overall health.
